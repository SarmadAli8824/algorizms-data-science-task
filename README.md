# Uqaab Logistics Data Analysis - Internship Practical Test

## Overview
This project is a Data Science & Analytics practical test for the Algorithms internship program. The purpose of this task is to analyze shipment data for **Uqaab**, a digital platform aiming to revolutionize Pakistan's trucking industry.

## Objective
The goal is to uncover valuable logistics insights from shipment data using Python. The analysis provides metrics that help Uqaab optimize their operations and decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
A synthetic shipment dataset was generated with the following fields:
- ShipmentID
- Origin
- Destination
- Distance (km)
- ShipmentDate
- DriverID
- TruckID
- ShipmentStatus

### Key Metrics Analyzed:
- Average Shipment Distance
- Most Frequent Routes
- Driver Utilization Rates
- Shipment Volume by Region
- Peak Shipping Periods
- Shipment Delays by Region

## Visualizations
The following charts were created:
- Average shipment distance bar chart
- Top 5 most frequent routes bar chart
- Driver utilization bar plot
- Shipment volume by region bar chart
- Monthly shipment volume line graph
- Shipment delays by region bar chart

## Summary of Findings
1. The **average shipment distance** is a key metric for estimating fuel and delivery time.
2. **Top shipping routes** show the most active logistics corridors.
3. **Driver utilization** indicates varying workload distribution.
4. **Lahore** emerged as the most active shipping origin, suggesting its central role in logistics.
5. **Peak shipping months** help in resource and capacity planning.
6. **Delays** were more frequent for shipments starting from Karachi, which may need further operational review.
